        <h3 style="font-family: 'monotype corsiva';">INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>
        The first chapter introduced four types of javascript values: booleans, strings, numbers and undefined values. 
        These values can be created by typing in their names, for example (null, true) or value, (12, "abc").
        I also learnt about operators and logic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Programs are built with statements, statements contain expressions.
        Using statements one after the other allows the program to be executed from top to bottom, 
        disturbances can be brought into the flow using conditional and looping statements like
        (if, else, switch) and (while, do, for).
        Bindings are used to file pieces of data under a name and are useful for tracking state in programs.
        Functions are special values that contain a piece of program.
        You can call a function by writing functionName(argument).
    </p>

    <h3 style="font-family: 'monotype corsiva';">FUNCTIONS</h3>
    <p>
        Functions are createdwith expressions that begin with the keyword <b>function</b>. they have a set of a parameters and 
        a body that contains the statements that are to be executed when the function is called. the <b>function</b> body must 
        always be wrapped in braces({}), even when it only consists of a single statement.
        A  funtion can have many parameters or no parameters at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every binding has a scope, the scope is part of the program in which the binding is visible. if a binding is defined 
        outside a function or block, the scope is the whole program. they are called global because one can refer to them anywhere.
        Bindings created for function parameters or defined inside a funtion can only be referred to in that function, hence they are called local.
        When bindings are created with <b>let</b> and <b>const</b>, they are local to that block they are declared in,
        so if one is created inside a loop, the codes before and after the loop can't 'see' it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lexical scoping is when each local scope can see all the local scopes that contain it and all scopes can see the global scope.
        Being able to reference a specific instance of a local binding in an enclosing scope is called a closure.
        To fully understand functins, one has to understand scopes, each block creates a new scope. 
        Parameters and bindings declared in a scope are local and aren't visible from the outside. Bindings declared with <b>var</b> 
        behave differently. They end up in the nearest function scope or the global scope.
